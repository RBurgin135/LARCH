# LARCH arcade top-down shooter

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

The game movement is based on SUVAT mechanics, so every object has mass, momentum etc. Players will dogfight until there is a winner. Bullets bounce off walls only once, and to regain shield you need to wait until the cooldown is off, then bounce against any wall. Weapons overheat if fired too frequently. Each ship has very different stats.

## Controls:
 Player 1:
 - space to shoot
 - W to accelerate
 - A to rotate anti-clockwise
 - D to rotate clockwise
 - Before round starts:
    - W and S to select ship
    - space to lock in
 
 Player 2:
 - numpad enter to shoot
 - up arrow to accelerate
 - left arrow to rotate anti-clockwise
 - right arrow to rotate clockwise
 - Before round starts:
    - up and down arrow to select ship
    - numpad enter to lock in
